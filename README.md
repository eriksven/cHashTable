# cHashTable
A hash table class for Dataflex that supports values of any type, from basic types to structs and arrays. Since the Dataflex standard library doesn't include a dictionary type, you are free and safe to download and use this library if you need one. It's been around since 2013 and is actively maintained in 2021.

## Code Examples

```dataflex
Use cHashTable.pkg

...

Handle hHashTable
String sValue
String[] saKeys

// cHashTable is a Class and can be instantiated in any way supported by Dataflex
Get Create U_cHashTable to hHashTable

// Use the Set and Get keywords to store and access data
Set Value of hHashTable "Key" to "Value"
Get Value of hHashTable "Key" to sValue

// Use the Keys function to get an array of all keys that currently exist
Get Keys of hHashTable to saKeys

// Use the Clear procedure to clear all entries
Send Clear of hHashTable

// Finally, don't forget to deallocate!
Send Destroy of hHashTable
```
